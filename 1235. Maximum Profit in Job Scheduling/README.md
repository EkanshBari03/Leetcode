# [1235. Maximum Profit in Job Scheduling](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-profit-in-job-scheduling)

## Description

<p>We have <code>n</code> jobs, where every job is scheduled to be done from <code>startTime[i]</code> to <code>endTime[i]</code>, obtaining a profit of <code>profit[i]</code>.</p>

<p>You&#39;re given the <code>startTime</code>, <code>endTime</code> and <code>profit</code> arrays, return the maximum profit you can take such that there are no two jobs in the subset with overlapping time range.</p>

<p>If you choose a job that ends at time <code>X</code> you will be able to start another job that starts at time <code>X</code>.</p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> startTime = [1,2,3,3], endTime = [3,4,5,6], profit = [50,10,40,70]
<strong>Output:</strong> 120
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The subset chosen is the first and fourth job. 
Time range [1-3]+[3-6] , we get profit of 120 = 50 + 70.

<strong>Input:</strong> startTime = [1,2,3,4,6], endTime = [3,5,10,6,9], profit = [20,20,100,70,60]
<strong>Output:</strong> 150
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The subset chosen is the first, fourth and fifth job. 
Profit obtained 150 = 20 + 70 + 60.

## Solutions

**Solution 1: Memoization Search + Binary Search**

First, we sort the jobs by start time in ascending order, then design a function $dfs(i)$ to represent the maximum profit that can be obtained starting from the $i$-th job. The answer is $dfs(0)$.

The calculation process of function $dfs(i)$ is as follows:

For the $i$-th job, we can choose to do it or not. If we don't do it, the maximum profit is $dfs(i + 1)$; if we do it, we can use binary search to find the first job that starts after the end time of the $i$-th job, denoted as $j$, then the maximum profit is $profit[i] + dfs(j)$. We take the larger of the two. That is:

$$
dfs(i)=\max(dfs(i+1),profit[i]+dfs(j))
$$

Where $j$ is the smallest index that satisfies $startTime[j] \ge endTime[i]$.

In this process, we can use memoization search to save the answer of each state to avoid repeated calculations.

The time complexity is $O(n \times \log n)$, where $n$ is the number of jobs.

**Solution 2: Dynamic Programming + Binary Search**

We can also change the memoization search in Solution 1 to dynamic programming.

First, sort the jobs, this time we sort by end time in ascending order, then define $dp[i]$, which represents the maximum profit that can be obtained from the first $i$ jobs. The answer is $dp[n]$. Initialize $dp[0]=0$.

For the $i$-th job, we can choose to do it or not. If we don't do it, the maximum profit is $dp[i]$; if we do it, we can use binary search to find the last job that ends before the start time of the $i$-th job, denoted as $j$, then the maximum profit is $profit[i] + dp[j]$. We take the larger of the two. That is:

$$
dp[i+1] = \max(dp[i], profit[i] + dp[j])
$$

Where $j$ is the largest index that satisfies $endTime[j] \leq startTime[i]$.

The time complexity is $O(n \times \log n)$, where $n$ is the number of jobs.
